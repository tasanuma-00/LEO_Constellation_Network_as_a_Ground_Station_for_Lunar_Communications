This paper presents a systems analysis of a next-generation lunar communication architecture from a wireless engineering perspective. The study evaluates and compares the performance of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) and a low Earth orbit (LEO) constellation as ground station options for a lunar communication system consisting of three satellites in distinct 12-hour orbits: a circular equatorial orbit, a north elliptical orbit, and a south elliptical orbit. The DSN comprises ground stations in Goldstone, Madrid, and Canberra, while the LEO constellation is modeled as a 24-satellite Walker Delta configuration at 600 km altitude. Simulation results reveal that employing a LEO constellation as a ground station provides significantly greater resilience, with an average of 23 line-of-sight (LOS) links available to the lunar constellation, compared to only 2 LOS links for the DSN. While cone angles were large for both architectures, exceeding 70◦, the LEO constellation demonstrated the potential to reduce these angles by leveraging alternative LOS links. Future work will focus on refining RF parameters for the LEO satellites and developing a more optimal LOS link selection algorithm to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the proposed system.
